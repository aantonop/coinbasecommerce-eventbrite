A basic prototype for integration between Coinbase Commerce and Eventbrite, to sell event tickets for crypto-currencies

Run on a server, send Coinbase Commerce events using a webhook to the integration app. It creates "discount codes" in Eventbrite with a 100% discount for the right number of tickets, allowing crypto buyers to select their seats and receive an Eventbrite ticket. Buyers are redirected to Eventbrite from the Coinbase Commerce checkout using a Javascript event callback.

Sorry for the limited documentation - I hope to write a more detailed guide at some later time.
